- Initial Release

---------------------------------------------------

What is this file?

This file explains how to make use of source code for computing A-KAZE features
and an a practical image matching application.

Library Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is mainly based on the OpenCV library using the C++ interface.

In order to compile the code, the following libraries to be installed on your system:
- OpenCV version 2.4.0 or higher
- Cmake version 2.6 or higher

If you want to use OpenMP parallelization you will need to install OpenMP in your system
In Linux you can do this by installing the gomp library

You will also need doxygen in case you need to generate the documentation

Tested compilers
- GCC 4.2-4.7
- Clang 5.0 (from Xcode 5)

Tested systems:
- Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, 12.10
- Kubuntu 10.04
- Mac OS X 10.8

Getting Started
---------------------------------------------------

Compiling:
$] mkdir build
$] cd build
$] cmake ..
$] make

Additionally you can also install the library in /usr/local/akaze/lib by typing:
$] sudo make install

If the compilation is successful you should see three executables in the folder bin:
- akaze_features
- akaze_match
- akaze_compare

Additionally, the library libAKAZE.so will be created in the folder lib.

If there is any error in the compilation, perhaps some libraries are missing.
Please check the Library dependencies section.

Examples:
To see how the code works, examine the three examples provided.

Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the working folder type:
doxygen 

The documentation will be generated in the ./doc folder

Computing A-KAZE Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For running the program you need to type in the command line the following arguments:
./akaze_features img.jpg options

The options are not mandatory. In case you do not specify additional options, default arguments will be
used. Here is a description of the additional options:

--verbose if verbosity is required
--help for showing the command line options
--soffset the base scale offset (sigma units)
--omax the coarsest nonlinear scale space level (sigma units)
--nsublevels number of sublevels per octave
--diffusivity diffusivity function 0 -> PM 1, 1 -> PM 2, 2 -> Weickert
--dthreshold Feature detector threshold response for accepting points
--descriptor Descriptor Type 0 -> SURF, 1 -> M-SURF, 2 -> M-LDB
--upright 0 -> Rotation Invariant, 1 -> No Rotation Invariant
--descriptor_channels Descriptor Channels for M-LDB. Valid values: 1, 2 (intensity+gradient magnitude), 3(intensity + X and Y gradients)
--descriptor_size Descriptor size for M-LDB in bits. 0 means the full length descriptor (486). Any other value will use a random bit selection
--show_results 1 in case we want to show detection results. 0 otherwise

Important Things:
• Check config.h in case you would like to change the value of some default settings
• The k constrast factor is computed as the 70% percentile of the gradient histogram of a
smoothed version of the original image. Normally, this empirical value gives good results, but
depending on the input image the diffusion will not be good enough. Therefore I highly
recommend you to visualize the output images from save_scale_space and test with other k
factors if the results are not satisfactory

Image Matching Example with A-KAZE Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code contains one program to perform image matching between two images.
If the ground truth transformation is not provided, the program estimates a fundamental matrix or a planar homography using
RANSAC between the set of correspondences between the two images.

For running the program you need to type in the command line the following arguments:
./akaze_match img1.jpg img2.pgm homography.txt options

The options are not mandatory. In case you do not specify additional options, default arguments will be
used. 

The datasets folder contains the Iguazu dataset described in the paper and additional datasets from Mikolajczyk et al. evaluation.
The Iguazu dataset was generated by adding Gaussian noise of increasing standard deviation.

For example, with the default configuration parameters used in the current code version you should get
the following results:

./akaze_match ../../datasets/iguazu/img1.pgm ../../datasets/iguazu/img4.pgm ../../datasets/iguazu/H1to4p --descriptor 2
Number of Keypoints Image 1: 1137
Number of Keypoints Image 2: 1046
KAZE Features Extraction Time (ms): 228.145
Matching Descriptors Time (ms): 41.3758
Homography Computation Time (ms): 0.028648
Number of Matches: 665
Number of Inliers: 605
Number of Outliers: 60
Inliers Ratio: 90.9774


Image Matching Comparison between A-KAZE, ORB and BRISK (OpenCV)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code contains one program to perform image matching between two images, showing a comparison between A-KAZE features, ORB
and BRISK. All these implementations are based on the OpenCV library. 

The program assumes that the ground truth transformation is provided

For running the program you need to type in the command line the following arguments:
./akaze_compare img1.jpg img2.pgm homography.txt options

For example, running kaze_compare with the first and third images from the boat dataset you should get the following results:

./akaze_compare ../../datasets/boat/img1.pgm ../../datasets/boat/img3.pgm ../../datasets/boat/H1to3p --dthreshold 0.004 --dthreshold2 0.004 --diffusivity 1 --descriptor 2 --nsublevels 3

ORB Results
**************************************
Number of Keypoints Image 1: 1510
Number of Keypoints Image 2: 1516
Number of Matches: 304
Number of Inliers: 277
Number of Outliers: 27
Inliers Ratio: 91.1184
ORB Features Extraction Time (ms): 74.603

BRISK Results
**************************************
Number of Keypoints Image 1: 3457
Number of Keypoints Image 2: 3031
Number of Matches: 159
Number of Inliers: 116
Number of Outliers: 43
Inliers Ratio: 72.956
BRISK Features Extraction Time (ms): 482.781

A-KAZE Results
**************************************
Number of Keypoints Image 1: 1549
Number of Keypoints Image 2: 1193
Number of Matches: 414
Number of Inliers: 351
Number of Outliers: 63
Inliers Ratio: 84.7826
A-KAZE Features Extraction Time (ms): 230.502

A-KAZE features is because is open source and you can use that freely even in commercial applications. While A-KAZE is a bit slower compared
to ORB and BRISK, it provides much better performance. In addition, for images with small resolution such as 640x480 the algorithm can run in real-time.
In the next future we plan to release a GPGPU implementation.
